# Game Rules
You will be given a random number at the start of the game.

There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

You win the game by matching your total score to the random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the randon number.

The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.

Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each crystal.

The number of games won and lost are displayed. The game automatically restarts after a win or loss.

When the game is restarted, the player will be shown a new random number, all the crystals will now have 4 different hidden values, and the player's total score is reset to 0.
